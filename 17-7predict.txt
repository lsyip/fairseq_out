each one -- who &apos;s computers ?
and here &apos;s a surprise of surprise .
they want to live off the world ?
i wanted to been on this .
it &apos;s almost more .
i &apos;ve only two ts .
and day , there &apos;s a lot of meaning .
the same thing that &apos;s just more organized .
who &apos;s the simple ?
you could do it .
so why don &apos;t think about think ?
ok , who will it ?
first , we have to learn the first thing .
that &apos;s not for any rest of it .
i like this question .
but what is it re@@ medi@@ ation ?
we call it .
i want to want to ask something .
that is fore@@ play .

they &apos;ve got so much .
i never never matter .
and they &apos;ll keep a story .
we &apos;re in more male ages .
the data is , it turns out .
and nobody ever , no one .
so this is a true person .
and he says that .
they &apos;re not better than them .
i mean , i am there .

&quot; all , the industry will be . &quot;
they &apos;ve got to use the fo@@ s .
this is a picture here to work .
so that &apos;s an amazing thing .
and something about life , to create computers .

well , i &apos;ve got gre@@ ed you .
we &apos;ve been something about this , right , right ?
and the put that comes off and ...
this is not science , this is not science .
this is not a bad happen .
we &apos;re already about 4 tools .

this is not science , this is not science .
do you think for the kids ? &quot;
this is not a bad happen .
a billion people will be today .
do you think for the kids ? &quot;
i think that in my way .
and this is very simple .
i &apos;ve been carrying away away from my job .
