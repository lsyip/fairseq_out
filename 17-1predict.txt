and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
you just listen and start talking .
that really sol@@ ves the fuel problem .
you can predict that . why is that ?

what you might ask is , how does this happen ? why ? what about these ?
when they came in 100 species , dam@@ n it , one of them should have been perfect .
