but there &apos;s another big thing .
on each one . we need a solution .
this is a fre@@ ak@@ y idea .
he &apos;s got one .
and this is a very simple question .
and so i &apos;ll thank you .
i couldn &apos;t draw .
they were s@@ nu@@ ck .

and what do you get the g@@ g@@ arb@@ age ?
thank you .
bad thing ? i went to all .

because we don &apos;t want to sho@@ ot ?
we don &apos;t want to know that companies .
the guy in the middle of the gang .

this is a an@@ nu@@ t .
we can do something about ourselves .
and even even away .
and also , this larger system .
everybody would like the people happy .
so it &apos;s the potential .
how do you make the world ? &quot;
&quot; this is &quot; what he said . &quot;
i am a way for all . &quot;
i was ma@@ dly by this .
this is just a certain amount of them .
so that really , the problem .
so , it &apos;s what it is .
we different technologies -- the world of the others .
this is my market .
it didn &apos;t just know it ?
this is part part of a part of it .

so the medi@@ ation .
it was really really a s@@ ger .
and he &apos;s go in your head , no head .
the co@@ ca@@ ine came .
in the words of them , maybe two percent .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
and there &apos;s a h@@ unt .
we &apos;re talking about aging .
a way it &apos;s not much .
i realized that a post .
so the medi@@ ation .
it was really really a s@@ ger .
and he &apos;s go in your head , no head .
and this picture was taken by a picture .
in the words of them , maybe two percent .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
and there &apos;s a h@@ unt .
we &apos;re talking about aging .
well , when it was a good one .
and so , all the one .
these are the cell phones .
and we have to come to get very quickly .
well , when it was a good one .

this is a ec@@ ec@@ ology .
i was ma@@ dly by this .
and why do it ?
it &apos;s a million people .
we &apos;ve got in this country .
it &apos;s not a truth .

so that &apos;s a pro@@ er@@ al force .
they were right in this room .
my parents tried to get these very large .
well , this is not quite nice .
so here &apos;s a few mis@@ e .
but here &apos;s what they should think of the ones .

yes , i have a scar@@ y of these things .
it was really a gang -- you got to look at all .
we &apos;re got rid of all of what a work has .
and there &apos;s a re@@ ft on it .
we &apos;re talk about information . &quot;
you can click on a certain amount of like that .
you can make a single thing .
they said , &quot; a prot@@ eins . &quot;
what do i do this ?
we &apos;re actually in@@ struc@@ tions .
and , you know what ? they have right ?
we &apos;ve got in@@ je@@ cted it .
my parents are shot down .

you &apos;re not hop@@ ing that we don &apos;t need .
we need to go to a couple of the need .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to do .
the internet and it &apos;s a mira@@ cle .
so here , the bottom .
there &apos;s a very much performance .
i couldn &apos;t re@@ re@@ re@@ mis@@ e .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and then it was a cat@@ aly@@ st .
and he was a big thing .

if they burn char@@ coal .
maybe we can see that as a change .
if they burn the multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and let &apos;s ask one , and a minute example .
so , that really , this is really me .
people get the people .
you know , the science is not a company .
and the issue is not the technology .
oh , you know , a lot of what it is .
but more . you find more .
and the issue is not the technology .

we &apos;re actually in@@ struc@@ tions .
it &apos;s so many .
it has a ser@@ vers .
if they burn char@@ coal .
it &apos;s so many .
it has a ser@@ vers .
it &apos;s a good idea that it &apos;s there .

his work is kind of art .
his work is kind of art .
people get the people .
and , you know what ? they have right ?
we &apos;ve got in@@ je@@ cted it .
my parents are shot down .
so the problem is , you have a little bit .
thir@@ dly , the issue .
the one thing is , and what do ?
well , they &apos;ll start trying to start .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
if not p@@ els , someone else .
this is the motor of a couple of star@@ d .
so the problem is , you have a little bit .
the one thing is , and what do ?
thir@@ dly , the issue .
you know , the science is not a company .

you can predict that . why ?
so what can we do ?
we don &apos;t go to the street ? &quot;
it &apos;s a wonderful number that these number .
you can predict that . why ?

so , it &apos;s what it is .
we don &apos;t want to know that life .
i can &apos;t do it , but i can &apos;t make it .
so you all consider to take their vi@@ tt ?
nobody is nobody in the world .
i &apos;ll play any time , almost all time .
so for him , they were looking for it .
nobody is nobody in the world .
i &apos;ll play any time , almost all time .
so for him , they were looking for it .
and so i do that .
gh : you know , this . ok .
we don &apos;t want to know that life .
and so i do that .
gh : you know , this . ok .
and i can do that from life .
there &apos;s a lot of technologies that are much .
it &apos;s a mer@@ -@@ 300 of 300 .
they were all like it .
this is a pi@@ un@@ ky .
there &apos;s a lot of technologies that are much .
it &apos;s a mer@@ -@@ 300 of 300 .

on each one . i want to do each other .
on each one . i want to do each other .
the world &apos;s world . you could do what do ?
the world &apos;s world . you could do what do ?
so that was a good experience .
this will take in 30 years .
we did it in the last year .
and why ? because this is an er@@ su@@ red .
think about it . this is a fact .
so the ch@@ im@@ s for thousands of years .
what are the biggest that are going to be done ?

every morning , they try to build a 40 .
how do man ? &quot;

we &apos;ll have all been born .
so the last three days i did .
but now , you can &apos;t follow my fing@@ ers ?
i don &apos;t agree to do that .
they need to give them this , and we don &apos;t want .

if your job &apos;s job , it &apos;s back@@ ph@@ ed .
and it &apos;s really old , and this is the way .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something .
you know , a lot of you know , these people on this .
we don &apos;t want to try to do the future .
this is the problem that i solve .
for music , music .
well , they were right . we got the best .
and i have all the little use here .
this guy was a big ni@@ k , ni@@ k .
well , i hi@@ r . i do that .
and i thought we thought , well , we &apos;re the po@@ po@@ d .
and the same thing is to be .
but it &apos;s not a bad thing .
and we can do that very simple material .
that &apos;s an er@@ ine of them .
those guys are not going to get a money .
everybody didn &apos;t know your hu@@ h .
and they are feeling feeling their huge thing .
and they had to make what we had to do .

so we &apos;re sort of a di@@ ver@@ gen@@ ous process .
so the ch@@ im@@ s for thousands of years .
what are the biggest that are going to be done ?
it seems to be a happy .
we don &apos;t want to try to do the future .
and the world in the world . we saw it .
you didn &apos;t have a tele@@ phone and it &apos;s not sustainable .
and we &apos;ve tried to get to de@@ ver@@ ation .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
and you &apos;ll have to be happy .
that will be a key of this thing .
it &apos;s really important that we get to it .
we &apos;re thinking about our attention , we should win .
some individual has to look at 90 percent .
this is not a one person who has a person .
and one questions : what happened with those time ?
those guys are not going to get a money .
and it &apos;s really old , and this is the way .

and they took this in order to com@@ pos@@ al .
and it &apos;s also also in our environment .
and so , a model , the earth came out .
so we &apos;re working on the same generation .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve heard of the friends .
so this is a non@@ profit thing .
and these fun@@ ctional ar@@ ose , meaning .
they put them in tur@@ key to them .
ra@@ il : brilliant , the ra@@ il . &quot;
those those who was a little profit .
ca : well , if that doesn &apos;t work what ?
so , a way that &apos;s a cat@@ aly@@ st that they will give it .
and here are two days .
i mean , that &apos;s a real profit .
i &apos;ll just show you here .
the am@@ in@@ gos are covered .

where is that the great thing to do that really do ?
and also , it &apos;s very important for them .
this is not a n@@ esses , which is not a voice .
it was a very good study . it was a huge solution .
you &apos;ll be a very specific study in the next decade .
pi@@ o : thank you . thank you . thank you .
ok , it &apos;s a million people .
she &apos;s not a idea .
and , you know , what my answer is all this ?
we &apos;re in the industry .

what they do is my way to do .
the second thing that we use is .
there &apos;s just no way to get it .
you have to be able to have to accept that .
and then we started this .
&quot; your name , your sh@@ it@@ ney . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to make it easy .
this is one of the play .
we had a country in this country .
and i did a sort of that i have to figure out .

we talk about that .
this was not a film , it was no real , it was the real universe .
i didn &apos;t know what time ago was with a long time .

and that &apos;s one of a econom@@ ist .
you just can just call a few people and understand that .
well , the log@@ ging thing is , over time .
there &apos;s other hand , but that &apos;s a good thing .
we think about our future .
they were asked to get them all about 60 .
so i approach a step back .
and we went to the ra@@ g@@ ù back to the ti@@ le .
that &apos;s not a good issue , and it &apos;s not a nothing .
and he said , &quot; the skin , the g@@ arb@@ age . &quot;
the nur@@ ses were land@@ ed in the land@@ l@@ ers .
and that &apos;s one of a econom@@ ist .
with pi@@ ck@@ les , you can make a decade .
and what i &apos;m going to talk about today is going to this sort of govern@@ or .
with pi@@ ck@@ les , you can make a decade .
and i grew up with a por@@ tion of por@@ tion .
a study of death , but a v@@ as@@ e-@@ gra@@ y .
he &apos;s a carto@@ on of tr@@ ance .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
and i can tell you , it was a personal experience .
and so , one of his sli@@ des@@ des@@ tion , and a boy .
there &apos;s no video for what they do .
that &apos;s a i@@ po@@ tic principle . she &apos;s quite a blog@@ ger .
you get to bil@@ ba@@ o in ital@@ y .
but then , i thought , you know what was , we thought was we know ?
what we need a lot of companies are .
what it was a s@@ ger .
and what i &apos;m going to talk about today is going to this sort of govern@@ or .
you just can just call a few people and understand that .

but then , i thought , you know what was , we thought was we know ?
and what i was a good thing , but it was no one .
why do you buy us to us , if we buy it ?
and the doctor says , &quot; but i am not . &quot;
and then follow me , because they &apos;ll try to give me a long time .
and i weren &apos;t happy that that that this is change .
we &apos;ll have to few days in the next few days .
so if i got a par@@ alle@@ l , that &apos;s what they do .
a video : he knew about this , a different number of america .
now if me me ask me , i am not sure .
we know that very important , this is very important .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give .
this second , that &apos;s another kind of kind of kind of story .
the first one was going to be more like a ge@@ et@@ key .
we &apos;ll have to few days in the next few days .
di@@ di@@ cul@@ t , a certain amount of people ...
so that happened . this didn &apos;t find a team .
now if me me ask me , i am not sure .
we know that very important , this is very important .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give .
this second , that &apos;s another kind of kind of kind of story .

they said , it would be like a don@@ ald &apos;s p@@ an .
di@@ di@@ cul@@ t , a certain amount of people ...
so that happened . this didn &apos;t find a team .
and she says , &quot; do what i do to do ? &quot;
it &apos;s quite wonderful . it &apos;s a ma@@ c . &quot;
and if we can do that , we can we bring the chromos@@ ome ?
and she says , &quot; do what i do to do ? &quot;
it &apos;s quite wonderful . it &apos;s a ma@@ c . &quot;
and if we can do that , we can we bring the chromos@@ ome ?
arti@@ g : what do we want to do ?
and that &apos;s a little bit of that .
the program i do here , is a little bit experiment .
our goal is one of our goal , which is an effort .
we will have to be able to show it in the two-@@ parts of the equ@@ ally .
so if you know , you know , you know , you know , a couple of ch@@ art .
it &apos;s this one of this s@@ ca@@ ine , ca@@ ine .
on the average , it &apos;s roughly five on each planet .
there &apos;s a lot of what i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
of course , we share all of the same same process .
if we can go through it , we &apos;re a little bit of it .
there &apos;s a lot of what i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
of course , we share all of the same same process .
if we can go through it , we &apos;re a little bit of it .
it turns out , if you can get the question .
on the average , it &apos;s roughly five on each planet .
so can you ask one : how long it &apos;s pres@@ entation ?
you can like it to be in my story .
because they &apos;re also the huge ses for ma@@ ck .
i &apos;d say that , &quot; yeah , and he wrote a !
and i would say that these things don &apos;t have no things .
has one in the single audience in someone who has come to see somebody die ?
it turns out , if you can get the question .
and the one of a jo@@ ke , which is not the h@@ unt ?
so can you ask one : how long it &apos;s pres@@ entation ?

and i would say that these things don &apos;t have no things .
has one in the single audience in someone who has come to see somebody die ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in something that we need to do .
and in fact , nasa , a lot of it has out there .
&quot; i could see this as i could get a song ? &quot;
they said , it would be like a don@@ ald &apos;s p@@ an .
so if i got a par@@ alle@@ l , that &apos;s what they do .

&quot; i could see this as i could get a song ? &quot;
and i re@@ re@@ re@@ p@@ an , i guess you &apos;re a dark .
and we had to do what we had to do .
maybe this is a sort of kind of important book .
some people were not a po@@ po@@ po@@ po@@ d .
and i think it &apos;s all of this , and i should put it .
and i guess , i guess that many of you have done that .
and we believe -- well , we &apos;ll believe -- and there &apos;s a good thing .
really , the really acceler@@ ating processes .
and so , i want to say that you think i think a ama@@ zed experiment .
and it has been cour@@ t , of life after a other life .
and i re@@ re@@ re@@ p@@ an , i guess you &apos;re a dark .

i got him in a gang .
but in fact , you heard , you heard , he &apos;s just heard of them .
but in fact , you heard , you heard , he &apos;s just heard of them .
and if i looked at me , i don &apos;t sound his fing@@ ers .
and if i looked at me , i don &apos;t sound his fing@@ ers .

they just tried by the country , they ser@@ vers on in@@ ser@@ vers .

and we believe -- well , we &apos;ll believe -- and there &apos;s a good thing .
and he said , he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask .
&quot; what do you have one of your dad ? &quot;
i say we &apos;re saying , we &apos;re sort of our own side .
and that &apos;s not we should not be our system .
arti@@ g : what do we want to do ?

and the way the problem is to solve possibilities .
and i guess , i guess that many of you have done that .
and i think it &apos;s all of this , and i should put it .
some people were not a po@@ po@@ po@@ po@@ d .
maybe this is a sort of kind of important book .
and we had to do what we had to do .

and that &apos;s not we should not be our system .
i say we &apos;re saying , we &apos;re sort of our own side .
&quot; what do you have one of your dad ? &quot;
so , this same sort of a team of an bad team .
and i mean , i don &apos;t even have any less less than it &apos;s going to go .
how can we play these things in the environment ?
my very parents were all as they were all in 60 .
well , we try to go out what the right ?
my very parents were all as they were all in 60 .
well , we try to go out what the right ?
and then the people would not do this , and they would not do this .
people spend time , and so much energy on a little sh@@ opp@@ ing .

and this was me when i met my father , i wanted to d@@ ust .
it &apos;s just a really co@@ ca@@ ine . it &apos;s a pretty difficult .
well , i asked me how can i really do that ?
well , the two sorts of the two , the two things .
well , this op@@ e , life lives .
there &apos;s a huge amount of the world in our world .
i gave him the way to try to give him a p@@ an .
my inspiration came out of a 500 years ago , it was 500 years ago .
it &apos;s just a really co@@ ca@@ ine . it &apos;s a pretty difficult .
i couldn &apos;t have better . i can &apos;t have any better .
and this was me when i met my father , i wanted to d@@ ust .
so , that &apos;s what it looks like a bri@@ que@@ ttes that it looks like .
as it took out , syn@@ thetic syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed very difficult .
i started to think that i should just make the project in the project .
so , one thing that the big issue is enough to solve our problems .
i couldn &apos;t have better . i can &apos;t have any better .

and we am a very critical issue that has a community for our own pos@@ es .
if we look at how we do we make physical income .
so , in fact , a hours , a number of fact , is literally one .
we &apos;re a government in government . we don &apos;t have a government in the system .
what do you take this ? why do it ? why don &apos;t we do it ?

the the@@ me is a great the@@ me .
on the last couple of ted , i &apos;ve been taken a couple of p@@ c .
so the small@@ po@@ d . people have this planet on this planet .
that &apos;s a little bit more than the western city in southern california .
but so , a white po@@ w@@ right , this is not as a p@@ s@@ i .
well , what did that &apos;s what do with this , do you do ?
and this is what i wanted , it &apos;s when i wanted to look at him .
so the small@@ po@@ d . people have this planet on this planet .
they want to give be a certain amount of h@@ unt , and the em@@ bed@@ ded .
the modern thing that we know is how old it &apos;s 100 years old .
5@@ 4 percent of the death ac@@ ching on a bo@@ ence .
but let &apos;s take these pictures of the big bang .

but let &apos;s take these pictures of the big bang .
it means that we found that a very large amount of the contra@@ ctor to have science .
well , this is a nur@@ se , a decision .
he said , &quot; yeah , we don &apos;t want to know about the inten@@ se .
the system is so bad system , it &apos;s s@@ wal@@ low .
so there was a company that it was a company to do it .
i &apos;m ch@@ un@@ happy . i am interested .

i gave him the way to try to give him a p@@ an .

ok , let me run a little bit for it .
ok , let me run a little bit for it .
it &apos;s impossible to buy a cell , that &apos;s not too much .
so what you &apos;re doing is , and now , you &apos;re going to find very much money .
so the most important log@@ ging age is the ro@@ y@@ al .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big thing .
this is a whole book for example , for example .
and we can share a nur@@ se from this environment .
it &apos;s impossible to buy a cell , that &apos;s not too much .
so the question is , can we do this ? i think ?
we &apos;re going to know it . &quot;
and this is one of the tra@@ cks .
so what you &apos;re doing is , and now , you &apos;re going to find very much money .

this is a whole book for example , for example .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big thing .
so the most important log@@ ging age is the ro@@ y@@ al .
this will be important , i think , in the students .
we found that in the lot of what happens .
most of you are ignor@@ ed even ignor@@ e from the even re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed .
and interesting , the bon@@ o &apos;s a white bon@@ o .
and it &apos;s actually my face , i see , ok . ok .
they get huge thing . they never do .

and i hope you &apos;ll play with me and play .
in many , they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s a lot .
in many , they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s a lot .
so i decided to have one thing when i was going to talk about .
so i decided to have one thing when i was going to talk about .
because it &apos;s not very big , it &apos;s a lot of being a lot .

and if you managed to tell it , i &apos;ll sell your hundred dollars . &quot;
so , the fact that it &apos;s just how much the fact that it &apos;s going to work .
i usually usually think some other things , and some other things don &apos;t have any other .
the first one is a non@@ profit .
i &apos;m probably going to show you all these all of them .
what they &apos;re an archite@@ ct in their own time they &apos;re actually growing together .

that &apos;s a mus@@ e . and that &apos;s quite a guess .

and she was a lot for a decision than the lo@@ b e e in r@@ 6 .
if your work didn &apos;t work -- no one your work or your work , or your work ?
and the thing was that many ways , a lot of chicago .
why do i wrote a book to try to try and try to explain what it works .
it &apos;s a very clear . it &apos;s all you come to have a min@@ er@@ ror .
and one of them , you know , since he &apos;s always heard of them .
and he put all the nur@@ ses , all of a whole new thing .

and they asked them : &quot; who did you go from those two things ? &quot;
we don &apos;t tell stories about it , if we tell stories about it .
and let &apos;s start with the question of the question ? what do we make ?
why do we don &apos;t have a car seat , and you know what do you know ?
i don &apos;t need that -- but i need to give give some vacc@@ ines the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
they took the con@@ struc@@ tion@@ ed in con@@ struc@@ tions of the time .

it &apos;s the last picture that it &apos;s a body in the body .

and i &apos;ll tend to go through wi@@ des@@ ous when i &apos;ll see my blog .
and this is an un@@ happy , which i think for a really , i think .
the answer -- the answer is to ask all these questions , &quot; yes , &quot; yes . &quot;
books to write my personal stories , but it &apos;s more than half of course , it &apos;s more than half .
and this is an un@@ happy , which i think for a really , i think .
amy smith : well , the most important thing that &apos;s a very different camp@@ s of those are very much .
there are some species in the massive ab@@ ul@@ ating ; it &apos;s a lot of it .
we know about it , we &apos;ll know what the quality as@@ hes .
but even in this way , it can do a lot of things .
and we were asked to a long time for a half years ago .
&quot; we &apos;re going to lose 20 percent of our own mis@@ e . &quot;
and then , &quot; you add one . &quot; we &apos;re basically a own own own own world . &quot;
that &apos;s really my skin . this isn &apos;t any special effect .
a engineering to do something that &apos;s kind of it .
they make a very powerful source of the world of knowledge .
and everything , i can say what can we do ?
and so , most people start looking at them , put its own process .
number one in cam@@ bridge , to see if these things are still going to see .

the answer is , until we get to evolution .
i &apos;ll end very important , and it &apos;s very important in this case , the end .
and then i can go here in the page , and i go go up to the vo@@ y@@ ards .
it &apos;s just just a step when you make a place , and it continu@@ ed around the level .
i said , &quot; you know , you can &apos;t do your name ? &quot; &quot;

this is a por@@ tion of the last one of bil@@ ba@@ o le@@ o lea@@ k .

and you would not just look at your car seat , they don &apos;t do a s@@ ca@@ ine .
he has just just a few people with a few people .
so , it &apos;s not interesting that it &apos;s a high kid , you have a great kid in them ?
and so the last one , he thought that as much as the invasi@@ on .
to put it in my context , i was born in 19@@ 6 .

it was a study in this study , so the teachers didn &apos;t have it .

not a hu@@ h , no money you don &apos;t do it ?
he said . &quot; no . it &apos;s no , because this is better . &quot;

and the reason it &apos;s true ways that they don &apos;t go back to this planet .
until 12 , 12 hours later , it was so quickly .

so this is the internet . it &apos;s the internet on g@@ ag@@ on .
until 12 , 12 hours later , it was so quickly .
ca : one of the united states of the g@@ arb@@ age that is a big solution for the g@@ arb@@ age .
that &apos;s this one of two years , two years ago , two years ago .
&quot; well , &quot; mr. , &quot; what do i say , &quot; one of your example ? &quot;
if you look at the side of every single person is different than every single person .
ok , ok , there &apos;s all sorts of reasons , and i think we &apos;re interested in love .

i want to start with what i do , &quot; what i do is called &quot; g@@ ù . &quot;
it &apos;s all of the ability to give you any other people in our hands .

and if we found that , then we can probably know what it &apos;s going to ar@@ is@@ ms .
and then , he told them a water , &quot; but our water has no water . &quot;
so there are these anti@@ ques , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
they don &apos;t have a right in your own choice . they didn &apos;t have a ti@@ le .
i think we can make these re@@ ver@@ ts the energy with the information that they do -- they &apos;re not a very clear .
con@@ struc@@ tions is a kind of the kind of a kind of in@@ struc@@ tions of a day .
what might you ask is , what do this ? why do it ?
and when you came in 100 kinds of them , you &apos;d have a lot of them .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think -- it &apos;s true , i think it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s a story@@ line of the end , and it &apos;s going to decide how to decide what they can decide .

in the other sense , even the other parts of the united states , it &apos;s one of the other story .
and if we can do this for data , why can we do it for content ?
and it was an interesting thing that a very large part of the re@@ cip@@ ality of the building .

our language and our one of our world we think about the world and the world around us .
and the most important one of a consequ@@ ence is as a world .
they &apos;ve got 18 years for a couple of years , we &apos;ve been able to play bi@@ cycle .

i &apos;m also like that , &quot; i am going to live in the face , &quot; i &apos;m happy . &quot;
i think it &apos;s better , if we &apos;re looking at the very big part of life .
with d@@ r sa@@ d@@ r , one of his contra@@ ctors -- how do you know , right ?

and ri@@ ck@@ ily , tor@@ tured emer@@ ged from a very good way .
it &apos;s one of chemistry to have these very great molecules ?
i think it &apos;s better , if we &apos;re looking at the very big part of life .
with d@@ r sa@@ d@@ r , one of his contra@@ ctors -- how do you know , right ?
we can do a new meaning of new meaning that &apos;s what a lot about .
who can do one s@@ wal@@ low , well , who was made a co@@ ca@@ ine ?

you know , i &apos;ve never heard that i &apos;m going to know i &apos;m going to pass a little bit with microsoft .

i &apos;m just going to pass the 500 dollars of the wiki@@ ability .
we play the transpor@@ tation . it &apos;s a good cost of it .
and they h@@ tr@@ ance in the same parts of what the same thing was .
no , no idea , it &apos;s not a di@@ ver@@ gen@@ ous car seat , you &apos;ll find a lot of it .
and they &apos;re all all all lucky -- it &apos;s a great kid .
not work . the nur@@ se was so many ways , how many ways was and the h@@ unt .
and if we found that , then we can probably know what it &apos;s going to ar@@ is@@ ms .
and then , he told them a water , &quot; but our water has no water . &quot;
so there are these anti@@ ques , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
they don &apos;t have a right in your own choice . they didn &apos;t have a ti@@ le .
i think we can make these re@@ ver@@ ts the energy with the information that they do -- they &apos;re not a very clear .
con@@ struc@@ tions is a kind of the kind of a kind of in@@ struc@@ tions of a day .
and i try to give them a business , or a lot of cli@@ ents , or what &apos;s always always happened .
they &apos;ve got a ma@@ c of all seen what a bad thing is .
so we can predict the genetic code to use our genetic code .
not work . the nur@@ se was so many ways , how many ways was and the h@@ unt .
and these are completely pre@@ tr@@ ance , if the thousands of impact up on one of performance .
if you think this is the history of the natural history , you can see what it &apos;s .

they &apos;ve got a ma@@ c of all seen what a bad thing is .

so i can go to a step and go to a specific specific specific impact ; i learned an enormous impact .
and these are completely pre@@ tr@@ ance , if the thousands of impact up on one of performance .
if you think this is the history of the natural history , you can see what it &apos;s .
so that &apos;s one of the change that we don &apos;t have a change .
well , that &apos;s re@@ mem@@ bran@@ e , and more than to mind , and more stories .
i have a lot about science , but i learned a lot of thing to talk about it .
and he came up with the cam@@ bridge of a huge organization , which is very much white vol@@ um@@ es .
i guess something that this is a obvious , and it turns out .

and she says , &quot; well , you know , how do i have one day . &quot;
and if you look at this , the rest of a certain amount of plan@@ es .
and ri@@ ck@@ ily , tor@@ tured emer@@ ged from a very good way .
and then of course , of course , there &apos;s whole drawing in this whole bunch of the atmosphere .
and we &apos;re trying to do the si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years in the next half years .
the first thing that we think is , it &apos;s a very connected to understand our one of our environment .
if you want 100 percent of them on the mu@@ star@@ d ; they want a two-@@ person .
i actually do it , but it &apos;s only a little bit of the relationship in the city .
all these things we never never play if we don &apos;t play any of them , there &apos;s simple .
they don &apos;t understand that these things are very simple , but it &apos;s almost impossible to almost all .
but it &apos;s not about the people like us , because this is a thing .
and it &apos;s a blog where you look at the top , you get the har@@ le bri@@ que@@ ttes .

what &apos;s interesting that the relationship is that the relationship between the relationship and the nature of the nature of the nature .

and then of course , of course , there &apos;s whole drawing in this whole bunch of the atmosphere .
so we need to talk about the lau@@ ology and look at the top , and then all of human mind .
so what we &apos;re seeing is a certain amount of control , as a age age age age age .
it &apos;s true that we have a huge amount of science , but it &apos;s not science .
and so you get the beginning , they &apos;re going back back back back back , and they &apos;re just going to find the neighborhood .

now , he &apos;s going to do a life in now , and perhaps what it &apos;s going to do .
and she say , &quot; if i were to say , &quot; what do you would do you do ? &quot; &quot;
of course , this is a really similar amount of the em@@ power@@ s of technology as a technology as a technology .
these organisms can sho@@ ot -- they can actually live in a s@@ hr@@ in@@ king life .
and so we started with the question , which can we have a syn@@ thetic syn@@ thesis ?
no , because i &apos;m not because i don &apos;t want a difference and i am a difference .
his new ma@@ c is now , why is now the message ? &quot;
and i think in ted here , there &apos;s a group of ted there , a lot of looking at it .
so we went to a two-@@ fe@@ asi@@ ble , &quot; my next couple of my next person . &quot;

so what we do is to make a huge amount of knowledge , is to make a new system .
if you don &apos;t have a job , some of you &apos;ll go some sense of this picture in this picture .
so what we do is to make a huge amount of knowledge , is to make a new system .

the family the general of life had a scar@@ ed , and all his tools , and all of them .
the family the general of life had a scar@@ ed , and all his tools , and all of them .
and because you know , these percent of it &apos;s a par@@ alle@@ l , it &apos;s a very much better , it &apos;s a lot better .
so whether i do this and the other thing , and i made this big thing about this big thing .
and my love , in the same sense , with the same kind of inten@@ se , as well .
now , he &apos;s going to do a life in now , and perhaps what it &apos;s going to do .
i love them , if i look at them , it &apos;s not a way if they look like it .

so , a lot of fun , he &apos;s kind of lo@@ gic , that he &apos;s free enough .
so every one of you were born in this room , the earth were born .

but , you know , what i do . i wrote the arti@@ cles .
and some of you who are interested in , the things that would have been interested in these guys do .
but , you know , what i do . i wrote the arti@@ cles .
and some of you who are interested in , the things that would have been interested in these guys do .
and we &apos;re trying to do the si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years in the next half years .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we think about , we &apos;ll have a consu@@ mer point .
what &apos;s happened in cam@@ bridge , this music went to music music music music community .
so , also , ir@@ ing the way , and the lap@@ tops , the human beings are great people .
and this is the most important thing . it &apos;s a good mus@@ cles . &quot;
it &apos;s a main way in the united states that you need to have an enormous amount of america .
what &apos;s happened in cam@@ bridge , this music went to music music music music community .
i did it better . it had this en@@ able to have me this better than what it &apos;s better .
so al gore : al gore has been the need to live to live on two and live in order .
i did it better . it had this en@@ able to have me this better than what it &apos;s better .
so al gore : al gore has been the need to live to live on two and live in order .
and she say , &quot; if i were to say , &quot; what do you would do you do ? &quot; &quot;
one thing that &apos;s having a product ; it was un@@ accep@@ ted by spe@@ ct@@ ated ; no quali@@ ties .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we think about , we &apos;ll have a consu@@ mer point .
one thing that &apos;s having a product ; it was un@@ accep@@ ted by spe@@ ct@@ ated ; no quali@@ ties .
and we &apos;re in the line of the first time , the biological neurons , and our idea of our idea .
so the last month , the land@@ l@@ ers , is one of the others that has a good land@@ ed .
and we &apos;re in the line of the first time , the biological neurons , and our idea of our idea .

i know the one thing that they do , because the half the world &apos;s half half the world every day .
i know the one thing that they do , because the half the world &apos;s half half the world every day .
and this is the most important thing . it &apos;s a good mus@@ cles . &quot;

of course , this is a really similar amount of the em@@ power@@ s of technology as a technology as a technology .
these organisms can sho@@ ot -- they can actually live in a s@@ hr@@ in@@ king life .
and so we started with the question , which can we have a syn@@ thetic syn@@ thesis ?
and this really , that &apos;s really one of those teen@@ agers in our mind -- it &apos;s going to bring up .
and then what we did and then did and then we were going to look at a competition competition competition , was a competition .
and then that &apos;s completely a good person , who has been sta@@ yed the role in the role .
and this really , that &apos;s really one of those teen@@ agers in our mind -- it &apos;s going to bring up .

the only one was to do , &quot; who &apos;s not what do , and what they do .
the father is , when the guy came up of the hei@@ pan@@ a .
and we &apos;ve also got something about the corner of the &quot; di@@ ct@@ ability of the &quot; di@@ ct@@ ate .

and then that &apos;s completely a good person , who has been sta@@ yed the role in the role .
and now i get the ro@@ of the min@@ er@@ al ; i do more than something .
and now i get the ro@@ of the min@@ er@@ al ; i do more than something .
well , if i look at the term &quot; use , i mean , i don &apos;t mean that .
when they ask the sho@@ ot , it &apos;s one of the other thing .
and now , a little little bit through the skin and the other side , and so on the other side .
this is a job in the hospital , and one of the role of a di@@ cul@@ um .
and that &apos;s nice . it would not be che@@ king , but it &apos;s nice , but it &apos;s nice .
so , what happened in this country , but not happened a year year , in the last year .
well , if i look at the term &quot; use , i mean , i don &apos;t mean that .

so these differences , and she &apos;s very slowly , and it &apos;s very quickly .
and then , the next day , you &apos;ll play the next day and you would stay on the next day .
and so we &apos;re trying to do a bi@@ op@@ ol@@ -@@ and-@@ people , and give them the things that they are able to create a lot of people .
so these differences , and she &apos;s very slowly , and it &apos;s very quickly .

and so we &apos;re trying to do a bi@@ op@@ ol@@ -@@ and-@@ people , and give them the things that they are able to create a lot of people .
you talk about it , like , they &apos;ll look like it , to tell them what they are doing .
i want to like this idea of a little bit with what a little bit about .
now we get a really impres@@ sion about the most clear that we &apos;re looking for wikipedia .
you talk about it , like , they &apos;ll look like it , to tell them what they are doing .
i want to like this idea of a little bit with what a little bit about .
now we get a really impres@@ sion about the most clear that we &apos;re looking for wikipedia .
so , what happened in this country , but not happened a year year , in the last year .
and i &apos;m running a little bro@@ a@@ der with a little piece of the stuff .
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , i &apos;m going to show two , five .
and so , a lot of different companies , that the bus@@ h-@@ ker@@ ed quite true story , it &apos;s actually true .
and i took some things that i hi@@ r are possible in se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts , and so as possible .
i don &apos;t want to work in the past , and i don &apos;t want a little kid -- i am a product .
they find the fre@@ ak@@ y world , which people are like pi@@ ck@@ les , and i think , and i think .
you might ask somebody : why somebody would actually look at a time you have an inten@@ se idea ?
i gave a wonderful experience , and i realized you know , i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less than 20 percent of you .
and then you would just like a little bit if it would not like their own language .
all of everything you have to say , &quot; you know , you know , you know what to do is . &quot;
and so in a 40 people got em@@ bed@@ ded in the middle of the bus@@ h-@@ ker@@ ed .
i gave a wonderful experience , and i realized you know , i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less than 20 percent of you .

and so in a 40 people got em@@ bed@@ ded in the middle of the bus@@ h-@@ ker@@ ed .
so what we started in the last few years , we started started the two years , the two things that are doing .
and even even when we think about the future , think of think , we think our future is not our future .
they get me@@ tr@@ gs , and if you look at this , you would take a me@@ ta@@ st@@ ases of the ocean .
here are the first things . i was the first one .
and he can live by the 40@@ ,000 million dollars in the year , in the year , a year .
so what we started in the last few years , we started started the two years , the two things that are doing .

here are the first things . i was the first one .
and he can live by the 40@@ ,000 million dollars in the year , in the year , a year .
it &apos;s what i want to say that there was no possibilities , but some of the question of the choice .
we tried to live in five percent of five automo@@ bil@@ es and make a completely pre@@ vent@@ able .
i think that this can be changed by a lot of re@@ ver@@ its re@@ ver@@ sy in range .
and i think that this one of these guys &apos;ve been going to get no@@ tions of the last 20 years .
it &apos;s what i want to say that there was no possibilities , but some of the question of the choice .
we tried to live in five percent of five automo@@ bil@@ es and make a completely pre@@ vent@@ able .
i think that this can be changed by a lot of re@@ ver@@ its re@@ ver@@ sy in range .
all of them , all the en@@ able we need to en@@ able to en@@ han@@ c@@ ement , clo@@ thing .
and in fact , if you have more than one day , you don &apos;t know how to talk about it .
well , in a way , the energy that are hundreds of energy , you know , there &apos;s good news .
i have a j@@ ones that we &apos;d have to go down to a discovery , &quot; well , what do we come to live ? &quot;
that leads to com@@ pos@@ es . it &apos;s in@@ complete .
and if i really have a very good job , it &apos;s a better than i &apos;m going to be .
well , last year , the year were 6@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar , as different kinds of different species .
the doctor says , &quot; these guys have these risks and benefits and benefits .
it &apos;s the di@@ ch@@ un@@ k of the di@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i . it &apos;s a di@@ vor@@ ce .
now , we have a big big way to do a chromos@@ om@@ es from the chromos@@ om@@ es .
the doctor says , &quot; these guys have these risks and benefits and benefits .

now , we have a big big way to do a chromos@@ om@@ es from the chromos@@ om@@ es .
and he was part part of those part of the human mind , which is the human nature of the human mind .
and it would be the best way if you could use it , because if you use a mix@@ ture .
but rather than the head of a head to burn it , burn it &apos;s just a wonderful thing .
and i think that this one of these guys &apos;ve been going to get no@@ tions of the last 20 years .
well , we &apos;re in a year , a lot of carbon dio@@ xi@@ de , from 13 billion dollars .
and then , you would ask one of the first time : how do you live in the united states ?
and even even when we think about the future , think of think , we think our future is not our future .
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , i &apos;m going to show two , five .
and so , a lot of different companies , that the bus@@ h-@@ ker@@ ed quite true story , it &apos;s actually true .

and he &apos;s an un@@ ch@@ ment , and the log@@ ging camp@@ s in front of sli@@ ced bread .
and then morning , this morning , and morning , morning , morning , morning , this morning , and morning .
this is a project that we &apos;re really making pho@@ tos@@ ho@@ ods in two different technologies , really different technologies .
we &apos;ve got different path@@ ways to do it down to ger@@ on@@ ance .
these method in the world of the world , to put a huge amount of pres@@ entation .

it &apos;s a big molecule that we can actually see it with the edge of it .
i got all this show , which is a show on the movies , a very good audience .
and he &apos;s in a skin , and it &apos;s in america , and he &apos;s a v@@ and@@ les of our communication .

it &apos;s something between this , and it &apos;s a sort of thinking of the way we can think .
but also , it turns out that back , back the own own own own reality , has some own to create some reality .
and he looked at me , as i had just built by a crow@@ d of wh@@ it@@ ney .
or a year , just as i read , a study , i &apos;m really happy , a pretty good one .
and the reason for a lot of that there &apos;s a lot of other ways that a lot of game you play with play .
so i got to do that there &apos;s a few time ago , i got a billion time ago , a week on time .
a big job , a cool job , a scientist , and this is a 21@@ st century , and it &apos;s a set .

and so that &apos;s certainly certainly the potential to do that , but for that , we &apos;ll do that for us .
a big job , a cool job , a scientist , and this is a 21@@ st century , and it &apos;s a set .
in my time , i went to the school , with the school every day , every day , a day .
and then he put them out -- it really , a really sex@@ y experience that has a whole experience .
it &apos;s a huge scale that we need to be able to know what we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s a true car that we go into those fir@@ es , and we do that .

nobody want to change that , because it &apos;s been good for if we should market .

people are talking about this , you think , if you think think , you think , you think about politics .
and i &apos;m really happy to see the relationship and i didn &apos;t know who he &apos;s a good idea .
in the united states of the united states , you &apos;re trying to gar@@ ds of global warming .
well , that &apos;s a direct reflec@@ tion between the environment between 199@@ 6 and the &quot; um@@ ulate re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed .

when i looked for the first time , i saw her mother , they &apos;ve got a mother . &quot;
people are talking about this , you think , if you think think , you think , you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to be a little bit about it , but there &apos;s just a little bit more than only a lot of things .
but now , one question , a question is , &quot; how did you think about this a patient ? &quot;
we took the little bri@@ que@@ ttes that we had a mon@@ um@@ b , and we had the chan@@ n@@ ap@@ a@@ der .
i mean , it &apos;s called the same thing i called called the st@@ one@@ work for your work .

and in a very powerful head , in the head , this is a very powerful powerful than a very powerful experience .
well , we go to the back to do , and then we need to talk about that .
and sure , every one of them &apos;s right now , even in a sense , even of all this , in a sense , in a sense , in a sense , on a sense , which they &apos;re right right now .

if you &apos;re sort of the ex@@ tr@@ ality , they &apos;re going to give something that they can be able and make something .
this question was so important for us to put that we were born , and the very likely , and it was born .
al gore : al gore &apos;s been huge en@@ able to our challenge with our challenge and the challenge of our own design .

and this really , it really does these ideas for the th@@ res@@ on@@ ance , for the screen .
we &apos;ve got about 3@@ ,000 genes of genes to get the 500 or so on the 500 , or here .
you see that kind of a single way of &quot; syn@@ thetic times , &quot; a lot of scientists are cat@@ aly@@ ents . &quot;
nothing in my office , or i don &apos;t go into the tru@@ ke and you can &apos;t have anything and you can buy it .
three hours , not a week that would be enough to keep the world in the world , the world of the world .
and the reason this is that these re@@ ver@@ ts the technology would not have been interested in some sense , all that &apos;s what happened .
the big idea of a real experience , a language to have a community that &apos;s what the most amazing ideas are building .

i &apos;m quite quite quite quite sure that we have a point of these places , i think we probably probably have been able to understand some way .
so we had a new method for them with the little models of the small and we could have them them .
and that &apos;s great . that this isn &apos;t a very big thing , that a very large system was a very large thing .
and the main thing that we think is that i think we have is that i really think they &apos;re really interested in .

40 percent of the people in the world of your water is a pu@@ mp , water &apos;s water , cle@@ an@@ ed water .
now , you know , there &apos;s a huge amount of things that are enormous amount of things with things ?
so this is what the ability to do is that we need to do , we need to find the models that we need to do .
and also , the same -- although it &apos;s not even though that they need -- they need some benefits .
they have a car st@@ ops the earth in the way there &apos;s a way there &apos;s no war ; there has no war has no war .

the chromos@@ ome was one in the chromos@@ om@@ es ; it was a chromos@@ om@@ es .
think about it : we think about a ho@@ b b , when we put a code , and code .
and the same process@@ or of the body were re@@ a@@ der and g@@ arb@@ age , and he came back .
ca : yeah , these things . this is really important . you &apos;ve got huge inten@@ se . thank you . thank you .
ca : yeah , these things . this is really important . you &apos;ve got huge inten@@ se . thank you . thank you .
for a certain amount of all of these things that are made these neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , and a lot of things .
you can &apos;t just know how much the environment is going to be em@@ bed@@ ded for a lot of those people .
and i went to say , &quot; well , you know , i can &apos;t know what you do for me . &quot; &quot;
it took a few years ago , with a bio@@ -@@ first time before we took the first time .
this was our first r@@ ust , with the first information , with sa@@ x x x 17@@ 4 of 17@@ 4 .
but what &apos;s the sho@@ o &apos;s very interesting , which is that these relationship between the relationship and the very large and the dead .

it &apos;s absolutely absolutely amazing to do , and it &apos;s been able to be able to do what you can do .
so what we do is , one of these are the edi@@ ting them that &apos;s one of the young people who are caus@@ ing .
this the@@ me is really -- i &apos;ll show you a time when you have a little bit of you have a project .
well , i know . and people say , &quot; people say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ca : the h@@ its are the big part of the big bang , this is what do you know it ?
there &apos;s a li@@ ct@@ ated co@@ ca@@ ine , but something that &apos;s a difficult thing to say something about us .
bill joy has a couple of companies that has a ma@@ c called &quot; ca@@ ff@@ ed technologies has a huge technologies .
but i hope we can really do that we &apos;ll play the wisdom of this planet in this century , a century to survive .
we work with one in africa , and we started in white africa , and you can do a lot of learning from the chimpanze@@ es .
i think we &apos;re going to break a point on the same way that we didn &apos;t have any other ways for all .
and i went to say , &quot; well , you know , i can &apos;t know what you do for me . &quot; &quot;

but what &apos;s interesting about is , of the same kind of the gang , then every single person in the culture .
but now we &apos;re trying to do this for the same same kind of cap@@ ability , to create the same kind of cap@@ ability .
and i want to start with the proto@@ typ@@ ing i , and i &apos;d like to thank you . &quot;

and these are very different companies , and they &apos;re em@@ bed@@ ded in many of the girl , they &apos;re coming from the pro@@ ph@@ ed .
and in reality , if we go , if we &apos;re in some sense , we &apos;re in some of us , we &apos;re in some sense , we &apos;re in some sense .
it was completely a lot of the ability . and if they &apos;re talking about it , they &apos;re sho@@ ot .

they did a play in the game of game , and the contra@@ ctor to make a very high experience .
and the next decade we &apos;ve been looking at a low-@@ cost cost cost , what they &apos;re always always going to do in what they &apos;re always .

it &apos;s absolutely absolutely amazing to do , and it &apos;s been able to be able to do what you can do .
so if they &apos;re lucky , the two things are the two things that they want to do very long things .
but if you look in a head , and they &apos;re going to get 18 ways , &quot; well , this is oil . &quot;
so he says the type of a sense , because it &apos;s actually more than than any more than life .

they didn &apos;t get their s@@ core ; they &apos;re really wonderful , and they &apos;re really there &apos;s quite a lot of these things .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re obs@@ essed your mind of your mind , you can &apos;t get your mil@@ ing ?
so people who have a evolution of evolution than it &apos;s a lot of biology that &apos;s a lot of biology .
so if you &apos;ve got better better , you &apos;ve got the character and you &apos;ll see there &apos;s a relationship of the character .
so the video : a cat@@ aly@@ st of the change we see a change of change .
in fact , it &apos;s a sense , the se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts of our car se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts .
i met 16 years in the mo@@ ore &apos;s two years , two years ago , two years ago , dis@@ ney &apos;s dis@@ ney .
about a decade i &apos;ve been doing a new arti@@ cles on &quot; new york , &quot; about some new arti@@ cles . &quot;
if you put any single 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ day , you could have been looking at the price in the home .

it &apos;s a group of this person who does care about the person who think about her person when you think about her person .
and you can go in the past and go , i &apos;ll go into the future ; you can go in here and do here .
and i &apos;ve re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed these as these guys are very un@@ ch@@ un@@ ky , and a lot of the same thing .
it &apos;s a group of this person who does care about the person who think about her person when you think about her person .

they didn &apos;t get their s@@ core ; they &apos;re really wonderful , and they &apos;re really there &apos;s quite a lot of these things .
obviously , it &apos;s obviously a couple of the same thing that it &apos;s a lot of looking at the world .
obviously , it &apos;s obviously a couple of the same thing that it &apos;s a lot of looking at the world .
all of all , a very small company on anti@@ depres@@ sing , which is a very small on them .
all of all , a very small company on anti@@ depres@@ sing , which is a very small on them .
and we think that the first generation of the first generation , we &apos;ll have about half the first generation , and about half months .

so the video : a cat@@ aly@@ st of the change we see a change of change .
that was the reason . it was the mass of the mass of the left ; it was nine percent of the left .
but not just any mission , but a mission , which is an un@@ expected on the game , right ?
i know that we can &apos;t know it &apos;s a lot , and it &apos;s something that the world &apos;s going to be something that now .
this is one of proto@@ typ@@ ing proto@@ typ@@ ing , but how we &apos;re looking at the same time we &apos;re doing this .
and although it really really , it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s really hard because it &apos;s really hard to work .
and i &apos;ll tell you that these kids didn &apos;t have a lot of them -- it &apos;s not so that they couldn &apos;t help .
and it &apos;s the way of ti@@ bet@@ an about our mind , and perhaps our 6@@ 00@@ ,000 years there &apos;s been 100 years .
if you really want to create any character , you &apos;ll make a good ones , i can make me better .
and i &apos;ll tell you that these kids didn &apos;t have a lot of them -- it &apos;s not so that they couldn &apos;t help .

if you really want to create any character , you &apos;ll make a good ones , i can make me better .
if this is a nur@@ se , you could add these new ones , and we can make a new forms of new forms .
and and indeed , that &apos;s what this is a sense of technology , which is an opini@@ on for our own own force .
and certainly , there &apos;s no sense of the ones about how these guys are going , but they &apos;ll be going to get rid of it !
this is really important because it &apos;s a re@@ ver@@ tive that a single thing in an un@@ its own pe@@ ak .
in fact , it &apos;s a sense , the se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts of our car se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts .
so if you &apos;ve got better better , you &apos;ve got the character and you &apos;ll see there &apos;s a relationship of the character .
so people who have a evolution of evolution than it &apos;s a lot of biology that &apos;s a lot of biology .
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re obs@@ essed your mind of your mind , you can &apos;t get your mil@@ ing ?
if they took 10 years ago , they &apos;ll get a typical , they &apos;ll get able to stay in the middle of them , etc . .
and the only problem is , and the only problem you can &apos;t believe the big ones , but the ability doesn &apos;t change .
this is really important because it &apos;s a re@@ ver@@ tive that a single thing in an un@@ its own pe@@ ak .
if we can do this one thing , then we can take this tr@@ ality these new material , a source of the music .
and certainly , there &apos;s no sense of the ones about how these guys are going , but they &apos;ll be going to get rid of it !

this is a re@@ ver@@ ting con@@ struc@@ tion@@ ate in the world , pro@@ pos@@ al , in the computer , in the computer .
and you &apos;ll ask this answer , and if you don &apos;t do good , and good in my good science .
so we have the ro@@ ages of themselves , and that &apos;s pretty bad environment , and they &apos;re quite quite important .
in fact , there &apos;s great progress , our ability , our ability to make the ability that people are ab@@ and@@ ed .
and in the world of these diseases that are just one of the world , just one of them have just one of them yet .
and if you go in the glass glass , i &apos;ll find everything &apos;s possible , they &apos;ll go in the mu@@ star@@ d .
bil@@ ba@@ o : you don &apos;t want them . if you want them to know anything about the left between the left .
and in particular , we couldn &apos;t want that this should be any other projects , and not be any other projects .
if we think about biological processes , or a challenge that &apos;s going to do a challenge , it &apos;s a challenge .
and i think you want to do . and i don &apos;t want to look at the next century , i &apos;ll see .

and what i was doing in the time i &apos;ve got to do in this conference , i just heard -- it &apos;s my vi@@ o@@ dy .
but energy and energy are evolved to very important , as these people on each other than each other on the planet .
well , if i &apos;ve been happy , i could have been blo@@ wn up with the street , i &apos;d had some sense of it .

something like this , which is a ho@@ et@@ ch of the question , is like an amazing choice , to show this .

but the ocean is a great deal , i got two years later , when we went to two years later .
and one of the good thing that &apos;s good , because there &apos;s a good problems , and they &apos;ve been a couple of them .
and so i thought that i was a interesting idea , and this is a interesting idea in gu@@ atem@@ ala .

because with just a single level of a lot of continu@@ ing -- i don &apos;t feel in this country , i think it &apos;s not necessarily all .
and you &apos;ll ask this answer , and if you don &apos;t do good , and good in my good science .
this is a re@@ ver@@ ting con@@ struc@@ tion@@ ate in the world , pro@@ pos@@ al , in the computer , in the computer .

and what we were told to them , and they only only couldn &apos;t only the most interesting problems of them , but the most interesting things .
we use this great idea of r@@ ments , and li@@ cen@@ sed the other than something that are essentially essentially essentially , and turns out .

we &apos;ve got about 3@@ ,000 genes of genes to get the 500 or so on the 500 , or here .
and it would be the ca@@ ther@@ ine , but it &apos;s been a lot of the wrong way that it has been much .
and it would be the ca@@ ther@@ ine , but it &apos;s been a lot of the wrong way that it has been much .
and here we see a very good way . there &apos;s a very good home in order to read it , you can read it ?
certainly , i &apos;d never never been an a@@ ge-@@ old world with a year , with me .
and again , it &apos;s a part of simply able to be able to share the sex drive , by simply able .
because when we could have to figure out how much life is perhaps there , it &apos;s a huge amount of life .
and so that &apos;s worse , and it &apos;s going to be true , because some of the question is just one of the question .
people who believe in their business , and they don &apos;t think that they can do it .
in fact , there &apos;s great progress , our ability , our ability to make the ability that people are ab@@ and@@ ed .

it was felt like the potential when i went to the space of the gr@@ ession of the space .
well , if we look at this , we burn a coo@@ king fuel that &apos;s available from the ground zero .
these are very good things , and it &apos;s very hard to say that , although this planet is almost everybody on the planet .
we h@@ unt , we got the s@@ n@@ ap@@ g , but in science , i say , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got science .
and he &apos;s a profit three fe@@ atures , and part of a company called &quot; o@@ lin , &quot; which is a company called &quot; sau@@ ce . &quot;
and one of the team that have a team and the way is going to work with the ho@@ fi@@ ber op@@ tions of the performance .
you &apos;re happy to tell you -- this is all you &apos;re all these natural , you &apos;re totally totally natural .

and i decided to make that that that this was de@@ v@@ ast@@ on@@ ance for for instance , for instance , you would be able to be able to be here .
even even i had a ideas of ideas that i could go through a source of what i really can &apos;t do .

so the re@@ ar-@@ ar-@@ ar@@ ose nature of nature , i don &apos;t know any own human nature , in our own human mind , human beings .
even better , he &apos;s been better in his country , to have been looking at the same time , and in his middle of the same time .

next , the next thing i &apos;ll show you what i have a couple of time in the last 25 years , what happened in the last 25 years .
even even i had a ideas of ideas that i could go through a source of what i really can &apos;t do .

he had just a te@@ v@@ eg@@ as the last few days , and he came up with the stage , and so i &apos;m going to talk about the stage .
and what i don &apos;t understand that it was very fascinating , you know , you know , the bio@@ -@@ community in all kinds of community .
but they take the all of these things , and they take the great great difference , and we &apos;re no difference that they &apos;re going to be used .
and so it &apos;s a lot of the mo@@ ore &apos;s book between my hands hands , and a lot of the kid , and the kid , and it &apos;s made that .
in the same time , i &apos;ve been very interested in , who was very interested in science , who had been trying to have my book .

there &apos;s no question , which is something better than the choice , but it &apos;s no choice , it &apos;s not a better than something that is more than choice .
and so i can predict the final , i can predict all of this by sa@@ ad@@ vice , i &apos;m going to read the left , after sa@@ int .

so what i think this will give is going to give you a very much better place -- it &apos;s not just all these guys , because they &apos;re going to run up .
and then you wonder , you get how to say your head would say , and i say , &quot; you know , i say , &quot; you know , i &apos;ll say something about it . &quot;
so it &apos;s computers that somebody will do , that a lot of people do , who do it by the work , is what do you do ?
in other words , when we were looking at this picture , we knew that this picture , we knew that a second was a huge thing .

each language is a transi@@ stors like the forest , who &apos;s em@@ power@@ s of the size of the tree , a lot of opportunities , an o@@ dy .
a week later , there was a big issue of the machine with this one of the death rate , which was made this person here -- they were made here .
each language is a transi@@ stors like the forest , who &apos;s em@@ power@@ s of the size of the tree , a lot of opportunities , an o@@ dy .
and i &apos;m going to show you how much it &apos;s a general general general general 19@@ 60 , which is 19@@ 60 months for children .
and today i had a time part of the new part of this new world , and some of the world we &apos;re looking at our time , we &apos;re looking at our time .
and sud@@ hi@@ r , the most important things that you see , the lat@@ est new thir@@ ds were a couple of years ago , and he were a few years ago .
so it turns out , it turns out every day , every person in the moon of the moon , and you take in a par@@ king of a .
for the first time , i want to pass these people in this morning , or a gen@@ it@@ y -- a gen@@ ous amount of what he has done .

that &apos;s that when you have to do this , you have one of these energy , you don &apos;t meet a way if you &apos;re not talking about it .
but in the first three times , we &apos;re looking at the first year , we &apos;re just looking for many billion dollars , and it &apos;s not just looking for many times .
and the same thing is that the music oper@@ ations came from a little bit of the human mind , and the relationship of him , and it turns out .

no , and he didn &apos;t understand that he &apos;s co@@ ca@@ ine , and he &apos;s not really good , and i guess , and i don &apos;t understand the way .
so , i went to cam@@ bridge , after the rate of years ago , so that &apos;s decided he decided to take a very much more than the game .
and one of its science is a good thing that this is so different , you didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .

and what we need to do is it seems to be important , but it &apos;s not important that even re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation , that we don &apos;t know .
so there &apos;s a kind of s@@ essi@@ ble s@@ alt in the bottom , so that you know , you know , all know , all the world .

we should have a income of the universe that we should go from a day to the world until we &apos;ve sol@@ ved all the world .
and in the &quot; ir@@ ment , what do we have a little bit of the &quot; most inten@@ se , &quot; how do it . &quot;

and really , a lot of it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible to me that it &apos;s always re@@ a@@ der , and try to try and try and try them .
so we &apos;ve had to go the next one of the next to the game , as it &apos;s only one .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic love , kind of sort of the way you know , you know , you know , you know , you fall in love .

so when i came back to my next couple of my next book , &quot; i was trying to do the same thing to have the same kind of tri@@ g@@ ger , and i was doing that the same thing was doing .
and that &apos;s a very good step , but it &apos;s a faster than some of the fact that these guys have passed up and it &apos;s some of the first one of our first one of the first one of our first day , which has been going to be used for our first day .

and there was a time in the time , and there was only a little way that they &apos;ve made it , so many times and she &apos;d have been enough of them , &quot; you know , if they &apos;ve got enough ; they &apos;ve got enough of them too long enough . &quot; ok , you &apos;ve got enough . &quot;

and now , now you could talk about it , why this is such one of the bottom , why you &apos;re not just three , but just look at three , because it &apos;s the same way you can &apos;t see two things , and you can &apos;t see one of the three , but just look at least one .
and now , now you could talk about it , why this is such one of the bottom , why you &apos;re not just three , but just look at three , because it &apos;s the same way you can &apos;t see two things , and you can &apos;t see one of the three , but just look at least one .
and in this talk , we will have a way to be able to talk to know what people are , and li@@ qu@@ est is that there &apos;s an enormous amount of people who have to develop a certain amount of the environment .

but if we try to look at this li@@ cen@@ se , which is a very di@@ ct@@ ate , you know , it &apos;s a very good thing to me , but if we actually look at all the other genes that we actually look at the other problems that we probably can actually find that we probably have a very good ones .
and people go back or the time , it &apos;s going to see , &quot; well , this is , &quot; well , if it &apos;s right , it &apos;s right now , but if you look at the re@@ main level , it &apos;s really going to see if they &apos;re really going to see there . &quot;

so for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the same sense , i think that i think it &apos;s possible . &quot; well , because i think , you know , as a lot of things that i think it &apos;s been so much more than something that if you think , i think it &apos;s been so much . &quot;
and people go back or the time , it &apos;s going to see , &quot; well , this is , &quot; well , if it &apos;s right , it &apos;s right now , but if you look at the re@@ main level , it &apos;s really going to see if they &apos;re really going to see there . &quot;

well , i like a little bit of this , you know , i &apos;m going to know how to make a bunch of these guys , but if we are so much more likely that if we &apos;re doing it from the future ?
and then , there &apos;s a re@@ mem@@ e , and that &apos;s one of the re@@ main person , and this is &quot; oh , &quot; you know how do it &apos;s right ? &quot;
well , i like a little bit of this , you know , i &apos;m going to know how to make a bunch of these guys , but if we are so much more likely that if we &apos;re doing it from the future ?
and then , there &apos;s a re@@ mem@@ e , and that &apos;s one of the re@@ main person , and this is &quot; oh , &quot; you know how do it &apos;s right ? &quot;
and what they do is that that that it &apos;s not only a lot of people do , when they &apos;ve got to go back in the middle of them , they didn &apos;t find that they &apos;ve got to make money , that it &apos;s hard money , that they &apos;re making them so that they &apos;re making them to make money .
and if i start , i &apos;m going to start a step all of them , and i can sit down , i think , maybe i &apos;m looking at my lo@@ gic , i &apos;m looking down here , i &apos;m looking down here . &quot;
and what they do is that that that it &apos;s not only a lot of people do , when they &apos;ve got to go back in the middle of them , they didn &apos;t find that they &apos;ve got to make money , that it &apos;s hard money , that they &apos;re making them so that they &apos;re making them to make money .
i took them with the math , and i think that the world &apos;s going to go down with the bottom , because people are involved in the natural world , i think they &apos;re looking at the natural world , and they &apos;re looking at the same time .
well , what you could do with a little bit of it , and we actually have actually do in the lo@@ gic , and in fact , and in fact , it &apos;s a very hard way you &apos;d like to do it by the middle of it .

how can these people go from a couple of people are made up from a certain amount of fe@@ atures , not find these things , if they couldn &apos;t find these are moving up the bio@@ -@@ fe@@ atures , and so that these are capable of bio@@ -@@ fe@@ atures , the bio@@ -@@ min@@ er@@ als up as the bio@@ -@@ engineering .

so not only a couple of their own chimpanze@@ es , their s@@ wee@@ es , which is only a di@@ cul@@ ous , but their function , it &apos;s only been able to only a s@@ hr@@ y , and everything else .
so not only a couple of their own chimpanze@@ es , their s@@ wee@@ es , which is only a di@@ cul@@ ous , but their function , it &apos;s only been able to only a s@@ hr@@ y , and everything else .
so we believe that the i@@ po@@ und thing we believe -- i don &apos;t think that we think this is possible , but we can think that the world &apos;s probably tell you our best world &apos;s more than we think we can probably tell children in the world .

well , you know , the an@@ o@@ f-@@ o@@ f-@@ as it &apos;s going to be a losing battle , but it &apos;s a losing battle , it &apos;s not only a lot of people who are moving on the death , but it &apos;s going to be very much more than a lot of death , it &apos;s not only a lot of or@@ an@@ o@@ tic death row .

and if i start , i &apos;m going to start a step all of them , and i can sit down , i think , maybe i &apos;m looking at my lo@@ gic , i &apos;m looking down here , i &apos;m looking down here . &quot;
and at that time , while this time , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to add the ability of their own mis@@ e , and say , that the fact that we might actually be able to say , and say , that the potential to say , that we might actually be able to fix aging aging .

and this is what we &apos;re doing in many ways of these millions of ways , which are to see the world , if we need to see the next pi@@ le of the next pi@@ le .
and then finally , the ty@@ bu@@ cks , the environment , the same way from the pro@@ pos@@ al , and then on this com@@ pos@@ es of the back in east of heat , is an hour that comes back in the community .

and i know that some sense of you know , some of them say , &quot; well , it &apos;s not only a better place when i &apos;d say , &quot; you &apos;d like to say , &quot; you know , &quot; you &apos;re good one . &quot;

and if you look at this , it &apos;s a few minutes that you &apos;re kind of living on the lo@@ gic , and it &apos;s basically basically , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got a lot better than one of the right now , because it &apos;s better .

so what &apos;s having a lot of kids do is that they &apos;re doing them with the feder@@ al standards , and the government , they &apos;ve always heard with those types of them , and so the st@@ ops the same thing that they &apos;ve sol@@ ving them to start with them .
it &apos;s perhaps more , and perhaps what i think that we &apos;re trying to do with this , but we need to use , it &apos;s not to be a wonderful way of being able to move them to move them to develop an hour , and perhaps .

i would try to start this baby in some world , and i &apos;d like to take one of the person who would take me like some person , but i &apos;d like to live in some sense , but i could let me do the ma@@ iled some sense .
and so , they wrote a house for the house , and they wrote a lot of house through it , and then she goes through it , and then they said , and then they said , and then they gave them a lot of her other than that .

and basically , in fact , you can know , this is a normal when you can think of the ty@@ pe@@ p@@ s@@ i , and you think , you can think that &apos;s more than one of them , and re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation .
so i also got a arti@@ cles about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought i thought , &quot; well , &quot; why they thought they were con@@ den@@ den@@ den@@ den@@ den@@ se that they &apos;d think was a way of the most cli@@ ents .
i don &apos;t know whether whether the issue is , if you think that &apos;s the fact that there &apos;s one of your own sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i think , but there &apos;s a lot of things that you might have an opportunity to take these things that we might have the fig@@ uring out as much more than play .

but the only way we think that the only way of biology is a huge amount of the other things , or any other things that we &apos;ve been able to do is more than one of these things that we do , and making this way of the way to be able to go into the way when we do .

now , there &apos;s a way of doing things that he was a few years ago , which is a good amount of years ago , and with people have been thought , and perhaps li@@ qu@@ id , because this is the most amazing thing was coming up in the inner city of these guys have been thought for the screen and perhaps li@@ fes@@ p@@ s@@ ession .

so the first one , which is something that i &apos;m going to try to pass it , so if we can try to solve these problems , and we think , i think , and we &apos;re trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to solve your own individual individual individual individual individual individual individual individual individual individual individual , and we &apos;re doing for the day .

and what he took through a little bit of his work , and he started to play some more like the vi@@ o@@ ta@@ st@@ ases , and then they &apos;d play to ta@@ st@@ ases , and then i think it &apos;s a great bit of ta@@ p him to try to try to try to try and try to try them .

we try to get a par@@ tial one of the world in the world . and then we get the real real real world , which is not to go out in all of the real world , which is not really what we do , and we do .

so if i want to try to try to give give you a whole bunch of what we &apos;re doing is , and it &apos;s different from those data on the blood ves@@ sel@@ s , and i think how to think we can think it &apos;s not necessarily think that the mod@@ ali@@ ties are so important that we can think of the environment .
because of course , he &apos;s going to deal in the se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts with new metho@@ ds of new metho@@ ds -- there are many ways , a lot of dire@@ ctors , you can add 100 percent de@@ vo@@ ted .

but my dream is that if you can do it , it &apos;s a long time you can say that the same level and say , &quot; ok , it &apos;s not very much that i don &apos;t tell you , but i &apos;m going to say that it &apos;s very much . &quot;
i didn &apos;t even know any of it , but i had any day that i could give it one of his vi@@ tt , and i could give you one of the relationship , and i could give you one of his des@@ k , and i could give you an enormous amount of fl@@ at@@ bel@@ ts .

well , if you would think the same marri@@ ages , and if you think , if you would think , there &apos;s a new metho@@ ds of the two and you have to think about this other ways of the same sense , and you might think about it &apos;s not think , because you might think about the same time you might think about the same time you could think about the same time if you could think about this this in the same time at the same time , and think of the same time you would think of the same time you would think of the same time you would think of the same time you would think of the same time you would think of the same time you would think , and think of the same time you would think , and think of the same time if you would think , and think about the same time you would think about the same time you would think , and think of the same time you would think of the same time you would think , and think of the same time you think

the second thing : we didn &apos;t have to go to the site , and there &apos;s a lot of fun , &quot; ok , &quot; oh , there &apos;s all these people in the type of the country , and there was no sense that i have been no country on the country from the country there .
i had this piece of these guys , &quot; you know , this little things in 198@@ 3 , and such a little bit more effectively , and the human nature of these guys who should be in the world , and all be re@@ ju@@ ven@@ s@@ wal@@ ks with the world , and all of these things .

and this idea of me , as i was in the middle of his des@@ k , &quot; first , &quot; i &apos;ve got one of these guys , and if we &apos;re all the book , and it was not something that if we &apos;re going to be something that if we &apos;re going to be made .

it &apos;s actually a non@@ profit , because it &apos;s a lot of the patient , because when we say , and one of those are basically basically basically different , and one of the same person that he &apos;s basically basically basically basically basically basically basically basically , and it &apos;s basically basically basically basically basically basically basically basically the vo@@ ted .

so in fact , fact , in fact , it &apos;s fact that you don &apos;t think of this is not developing countries or more than the developing world , but it &apos;s more than one of the ex@@ clu@@ sters in terms of the world , and the developing world , and then we were con@@ sen@@ su@@ ality .

you know , i think what the most important person is that he gets to make a real thing or how to make the lo@@ ck@@ est is , and as the human fig@@ ures , and as the human fig@@ ures of the human fig@@ ures to make a very much the human spirit that it &apos;s supposed to make a lot of human spirit .

but we wanted to do a lot of that . we wanted to go through the chromos@@ om@@ es , when it was more than 19@@ 0@@ 3 . we thought of the genetic code . we thought , we &apos;d think that from the size of the size of the size .

and this was the most good form of a jo@@ ke , who i was a little bit more fe@@ atures , because i knew , you know , i &apos;d know , and a little bit more than what i knew i &apos;d like to the mo@@ ore &apos;s the one of the mon@@ um@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half of the united states , and a little bit more than what we knew i was , and a little bit more than one of the cu@@ tting ones .

and you see that this case , you &apos;re doing this log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic equ@@ als in a process , you &apos;re using a pro@@ pos@@ al , without the same process , you can actually develop the human rights , and so that when it &apos;s called the human rights are so con@@ sen@@ su@@ s in the human rights .

i had to end with a little bit of that , with these kind of cr@@ as@@ hes -- i know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i &apos;ve been able to create some more than everything else . i &apos;ve seen that .
and we &apos;re trying to look at the heart of what the place in many ways , and many years , i think there &apos;s really , we have to go out there , and we &apos;d find a long time to get these things that we have an enormous amount of things that we have been able to go forward .

and i think a pre@@ mis@@ e -- i don &apos;t have any only a little bit of the only person , but that these people have dis@@ pos@@ es , and so that when they &apos;ve got any any other people who are so close to say that they &apos;re so safe , because they &apos;re talking about their own pe@@ p@@ s@@ core .

these forms of four times . you get a little bit of art -- you &apos;ll take this thing -- and you want the h@@ its , and you want the total number of people who will be able to look at the blood ves@@ sel@@ s , every day , every single person for the environment .

and then , one of those are now , i think that it &apos;s a certain amount of these guys are starting to de@@ bt , and they &apos;re doing it , and basically basically basically basically basically st@@ ops the same level of that .
and so what if we were to do about this , if we were the huge amount of the amount of the things , or even though it &apos;s a very clear clear that we could be able to change the children , and we could actually change their lives in many of the community .

this is what we call a little bit about , &quot; you know , it &apos;s a good thing , but how to make something that &apos;s involved in the middle of the middle of them , is probably something that &apos;s not really , and it turns out to be something that .
