you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
they are building an ep@@ ic story .
we do achieve more in game worlds .
the data says it all the time .

and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
and so , recently , scientists have suggest@@ ed that hero@@ do@@ tus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and i started to notice a few things that make ep@@ ic w@@ ins so possible in online worlds .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
