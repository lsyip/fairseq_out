we followed the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about it , they gave them a little bit about it , they gave them that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his old age , and we were killing it with the spe@@ ar , but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
